// The golden games (crates/endfall-sim/tests/golden.rs): whole games the AI plays, pinned to state hashes at 10 s,

// (cargo test), in Node (test/engine.test.js), in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit in CI, and on a real phone at
// selftest.html. A rule change updates golden.rs and this table together (test/engine.test.js checks they agree).
